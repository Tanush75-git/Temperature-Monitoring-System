Temperature Monitoring System

Hello, this is my first project in the world of circuits. I’m excited to share a project on: a circuit designed to monitor real-time temperature fluctuations. Using TMP36 sensor, LCD 16x2 (I2C Module) and an Arduino/Microcontroller, as a beginner I learned how to calibrate analog signals into meaningful data. The most challenging part was ensuring accuracy by managing the voltage reference, but seeing the real-time output was incredibly rewarding. The difficult part was that the perfect arrangement of the blocks on the code.
This project helped me solidify my understanding of:
-> Sensor interfacing and signal conditioning.
-> Basic circuit design and troubleshooting.
-> Data visualization through serial monitoring.
